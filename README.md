A simple timeline I created, currently fully HTML to work in any browser. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
  - DO NOT REFRESH THE TAB, or it will reset all information,
  - You can save for further edits by exporting the JASON file.
  - (Inporting will overwrite any information on the page)
  - To share the timeline with others as a view only page, press download, and send that file to anyone with a browser.
  - While editing you can view it in three diffrent ways, A standerd 2 wide, a compact 4 wide(ajusts based on screen size), and a more simple "hotdog" list.
